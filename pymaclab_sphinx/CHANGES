Release History
===============

**0.90.1-dev** (2012-9-12)
==========================

    * Implemented the Christiano-Fitzgerald asymmetric band-pass filter to extract stationary cycle from simulated data.

    * Updated documentation substantially.


**0.89.1** (2012-9-11)
======================

    * Re-introduced sympycore as default CAS. It is MUCH faster than sympy. Now comes packaged with PyMacLab.

    * Also decided to always package the latest (working and tested) parallel python(pp) library with PyMacLab.

    * PyMacLab's parser now also replaces substituted items in the closed form steady state section.

    * A new parameter can be passed to pymaclab.newMOD(mesg=True|False) to generate diagnosis print-outs during instantiation.

    * Another new parameter is pymaclab.newMOD(ncpus='auto'|INT) where INT is some integer. Number of CPU cores to be used. Default=1.

    * Another new parameter is pymaclab.newMOD(mk_hessian=True|False). Should expensive Hessian be computed? Default=True.

    * PyMacLab now supports 5 different ways of finding a DSGE model's steady state.

    * One of the 5 SS methods uses externally passed arguments pymaclab.newMOD(use_focs=[],ssidic={}) to use FOCS to solve for SS.

    * One-off and queued dynamic run-time DSGE model updaters objects have been added

    * Improved various DSGE model templates. Monika Merz's unemployment RBC DSGE model is now working.

    * Further improvements and additions to the online documentation


**0.88.1** (2012-9-3)
=====================

    * PyMacLab now only depends on Sympy and no longer the outdated Sympycore.

    * Significantly improved documentation, now on its way of being first draft.

    * Translated some model files to make use of new functions.

    * Deprecated alternative ways of specifying law of motion of exogenous states.

    * Added new SS{EXPRESSION} steady-state conversion feature to Variable Substitution section.

    * DIFF{EXPRESSION} now also works for steady state expressions w.r.t. steady state variables.


**0.85** (2012-08-30)
=====================

    * Added Sphinx Documentation with API Section.

    * Analytical differentiation using DIFF{EXPRESSION,x(t)} now possible in Substitution Section of modfiles.

    * Forward and Backward operators FF_X{EXPRESSION} and BB_X{EXPRESSION} for X=1...N now possible in Substitution section of modfiles.

**0.8** (2012-08-21)
====================

    First public release.
